TODO:
    Before generating cars, find out witch type of cars would be most suitable for the user (SUV, hatch, sedan, etc.).
    Data validation, improve
    Figure out how to improve AI prompts.
    Continue on with more prompts to AI:
        Comparing engines
        Drivetrains
        Interiors
        Exteriors
        Photos of the car, exterior, interior
    Store response data to DB, so it could be accessed later on. If someone else enters similar user preferences,
    pull data from DB and not prompt the AI (saves tokens).
    Change the name of the project on git and update the readme file
